# Sentiment_Analysis
Sentiment Analysis using a variety of Classifiers, and two RNNs with performance analysis.

Part 1:
  Classifiers used:
    - Baies Naive.
    - Multinomial Baies Naive.
    - Bernoulli Baies Naive.
    - Logistic Regression.
    - SGD.
    - Random Forests.

  A voting classifier class is implemented, and uses votes from all the above classifiers for optimum accuracy.

Part 2:
  Two RNNs are implemented using Keras and tflearn modules.
  
Visualizations, learning curves and graphs are also displayed in addition to each model statistics.
